### Cybersecurity-related programming projects by Jacob Miller  
  
This repository is an abbreviated representation of my ongoing education in the field of cybersecurity. Currently I have completed two major projects within my studies:

- A custom keylogger that evades antivirus detection and establishes persistence
- A custom shellcode encoding/decoding routine that allows malicious shellcode to remain undetected by antivirus

These projects have primarily been a method for me to confirm my understanding of various cybersecurity concepts I have learned thus far through walking in the shoes of an attacker and using my knowledge to bypass current security mechanisms. More detailed descriptions for each project can be found within their sub-directories and/or in comments within the included programs.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Some of the programs included in this repository qualify as malware, so please use caution if you choose to execute any of the programs you find here.
